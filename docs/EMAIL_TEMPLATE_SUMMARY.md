# Volunteer Login Email Template - Implementation Summary

I've successfully created a professional volunteer login email template for your RepVolunteers app based on the AWS template you provided. Here's what has been implemented:

## Files Created

### 1. Email Template (`src/views/email/volunteer-login-email.html`)
- Professional HTML email template
- Theatre-themed design with blue header and emoji
- Responsive layout compatible with email clients
- Clear call-to-action button
- Copy-paste link fallback

### 2. Email Utilities (`src/utils/email.ts`)
- `renderVolunteerLoginEmail()` - Renders template with data
- `sendVolunteerLoginEmail()` - Sends email (currently simulated)
- `createVolunteerLoginUrl()` - Generates volunteer login URLs
- HTML escaping for security
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### 3. Integration (`src/routes/auth.ts`)
- Updated the existing `/send-link` endpoint
- Now uses the new email template
- Proper error handling for email sending

### 4. Test Script (`test-email-template.ts`)
- Demonstrates email template functionality
- Generates HTML preview file
- Shows integration examples

### 5. Documentation (`src/views/email/README.md`)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Usage examples
- Production integration notes
- Email service setup guides

## Key Features

✅ **Professional Design**: Clean, theatre-themed layout  
✅ **Personalization**: Uses volunteer name and custom login URL  
✅ **Security**: HTML escaping prevents injection attacks  
✅ **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile email clients  
✅ **Accessible**: Clear instructions and fallback options  
✅ **Production Ready**: Easy to integrate with real email services  

## How It Works

1. **Template Rendering**: The HTML template uses `{{placeholders}}` that get replaced with actual data
2. **Secure URLs**: Each volunteer gets a unique login URL: `/volunteer/signup/{volunteerId}`
3. **Email Sending**: Currently simulated, but ready for production email service integration
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and logging

## Current Behavior

When a volunteer requests their login link via email:

1. System validates the email exists in the database
2. Generates a personalized login URL
3. Renders the HTML email template with volunteer's name and URL
4. "Sends" email (currently logs to console for testing)
5. Returns success/failure response

## Email Template Content

The email includes:
- **Header**: Theatre Shifts branding with emoji
- **Personal Greeting**: "Hi {Name}, here's your personal login link"
- **Explanation**: Clear description of what the link is for
- **Call-to-Action**: Prominent "Access My Shifts" button
- **Copy-Paste Link**: Monospace formatted URL for easy copying
- **Instructions**: List of what volunteers can do (view shifts, sign up, etc.)
- **Footer**: Contact information and system details

## Testing

Run the test script to see the email in action:

```bash
deno run --allow-write test-email-template.ts
```

This creates `volunteer-email-preview.html` that you can open in a browser to see exactly how the email will look.

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Choose Email Service**: 
   - SendGrid (recommended for ease of use)
   - AWS SES (cost-effective for high volume)
   - Mailgun, Postmark, or similar

2. **Add Configuration**:
   ```typescript
   // Add to your .env file
   EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   FROM_EMAIL=theatre@yourtheatre.com
   ```

3. **Replace Simulation**:
   - Update `sendVolunteerLoginEmail()` function
   - Add real email service integration
   - Test with real email addresses

4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add email tracking/analytics
   - Create additional email templates (reminders, confirmations)
   - Add HTML/text dual format support

## Example Integration

The template is already integrated with your existing auth route. When someone enters their email on the main page and clicks "Send me my link", the system will:

1. Look up their volunteer record
2. Generate their personal login URL
3. Send the beautifully formatted email
4. Show success message

The volunteer receives a professional email with their unique link that takes them directly to their shift management page.

## Template Preview

The generated `volunteer-email-preview.html` shows exactly how the email looks. The design is:
- Clean and professional
- Theatre-themed with appropriate colors
- Mobile-responsive
- Compatible with major email clients
- Includes all necessary information without clutter

This implementation provides a solid foundation for volunteer communications and can be easily extended for other email types as needed.
